## Private API
We use Google Cloud Platform, specifically Google Cloud Run service, as an API service solution for image prediction. With Cloud Run, users can quickly and efficiently build, deploy, and manage Docker containers to process image prediction requests.

## Implementation Testing Using Postman
Through testing using Postman, we will show how this service can be accessed via POST requests that include images, and how the results can be efficiently predicted by Cloud Run. Seamless integration between Cloud Run and Postman allows users to easily test and optimize the performance of this image prediction API.
